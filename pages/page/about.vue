    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      We are building Thingadoo to be the go-to destination to find out what’s
      happening and what your friends are doing. More than just another event
      calendar, Thingadoo combines smart event discovery with social planning
      features into an app designed to help you figure out what to do, and who
      to do it with.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to create an unparalleled event ecosystem, we are leveraging
      machine learning to discover and qualify event listings, AI to assist
      organizers in posting and refining event information, and crowdsourcing
      tools to provide a final layer of quality control. Our customizable UI
      will allow you to easily find and track events based on interests and your
      actual friends’ activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our iOS and Android apps are currently in private beta, and we hope to
      release them publicly in Finger Lakes in February.
